## Data Visualizations for MakeoverMonday

For now I'm posting all visualizations made from Tableau right here in Github Pages.


### Personal Consumption Expenditures of Cereals and Bakery Products in the U.S.

This is my submission for #MakeoverMonday. The graph to be made over was posted in [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/beyond-grape-nuts-cereal-makers-had-a-very-weird-year). It shows the personal consumption expenditures of cereals and bakery products since 1959 up to 2020.

I wanted to focus on the years 2017 - 2020 to show how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the expenditures.

Have you ever wondered what episodes in GoT are the most violent? This dashboard displays the top 5 killers in the entire series. 
Start by clicking the circle of the killer on the top left. You'll then find out how many they killed, what season and 
episode, and how they did it.
