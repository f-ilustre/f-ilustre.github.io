## Data Visualizations

Here is a portfolio of data visualizations I made with Tableau

### Superstore Sales 2011 - 2014

This is a visualization for the assignment in [Essential Design Principles for Tableau](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dataviz-design?). 
The goal was to present the three worst performing sub-categories per region in terms of sales revenue to the VP of Sales. I also included my answers to the assignment.

**How does your visualization leverage at least one “pop-out effect” or “pre-attentive attribute?” Which one(s) was (were) chosen and why?**

The pre-attentive attribute of color was chosen to make the least 3 profitable sub-categories pop-out of the bar chart. Red was chosen to represent the low sales performance of the sub-categories. A light grey color was chosen to represent all the other categories to make the data available as additional information for comparison in the background.

**How does your visualization utilize at least one Gestalt principle? Which principle(s) is (are) being reflected, and how?**

The Gestalt principle of similarity was utilized. The sub-categories colored in red indicate similarity. The similarity is that all three sub-categories are the worst performers in the region.

**How does your design reflect an understanding of cognitive load and clutter?**

The Y axis was hidden and labels were used only for the three worst performing sub-categories. The gridlines were also hidden. These help in directing the audience's attention to the requested data - the three worst performing sub-categories.

**Is your visualization static or interactive? Why did you choose that format?**

The visualization is static because the VP of sales is not looking to explore the data anymore. She just wants to know the three worst performing sub-categories so she can cut it. She also has limited face time with the executives and needs to give a quick answer instead of telling a detailed story with the data.

**What need does this visualization address that words or numbers alone cannot fill?**

Comparing the sub-categories is fast and easy because of the use of a bar chart in ascending order. Using words or numbers to do this wll take time and mentally visualizing the comparison might lead to a misinterpretation.

### Personal Consumption Expenditures of Cereals and Bakery Products in the U.S.

This is my submission for #MakeoverMonday. The graph to be made over was posted in [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/beyond-grape-nuts-cereal-makers-had-a-very-weird-year). It shows the personal consumption expenditures of cereals and bakery products since 1959 up to 2020.

I wanted to focus on the years 2017 - 2020 to show how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the expenditures.
